# RickAndMortyApp
My experiments in this project: MVVM + Closure, Xib files, Infinite Scroll (and fetch data with pagination) and CoreData. 
I used The Rick and Morty API in this project and SDWebImage library.

# Description

The application consists of 3 different view.
- Home View: All the characters in the Rick and Morty series are listed on this page with the "Infinite Scroll" approach. You can access its details by touching the character you want.
- Saved View: In this view, the characters you saved appear. You can see the details of the character by touching the character name.
- Character Detail View: In this view, you can see the details of the character you selected. If you want, you can save the character in the phone memory by clicking the "star" button.
